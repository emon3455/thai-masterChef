                        How to validate React props using PropTypes
                    </Text>
                    <Text style={styles.text}>
                        At first we have to install 'prop-types' package separately using a package manager. then we have to import PropTypes from 'prop-types'. then we have to declare our expected proptypes using a static proptype object. then we can pass any types of props which we defined and they will automatically validated. if we send unknown type props it will give error on console. this is how we can validate props in react.

                        Custom hook is a reuseable javascript function that used in react to share bunch of code between multiple components. It allows us to extract and reuse logic that will commonly shared on components. <br />

                        we can create custom hook for make our code efficient and reduce the redandency of same code. <br />

                        we can create custom hook in a situation where we have to share same logic between multiple components. <br />

                        Some uses cases are: API calls, Authentication, State management etc.
